The linear regression model above shows the correlation between the dependent variable of mpg and the independent variables of interest: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD. The following questions are answered with this linear regression model. 
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length and ground clearance variables both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset due to the both of them having a much smaller p-value in comparison to the other variables. The smaller the p-value, the higher the level of significance.
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to there being independent variables with a very significant p-value. This means that the probability that the slope is zero is extremely unlikely. 
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
